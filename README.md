# Quizzler ‚ùì

## My Goal

In this project I will be showcasing my knowledge on Stateful and Stateless Widgets, as well as my knowledge on the fundamental building blocks of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects. 


## What I will create

I'm going to make a quiz app that tests your general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores!
